				<h2>What is a sweatshop? </h2>
				<p> Sweatshops are usually factories or buildings that house workers, usually with very poor and often illegal working conditions. These workers can range from young to old and work very long hours. The worst of sweatshops can make workers work up to 72-hours straight with no sleep, and many sweatshops have had workers complain about abuse and beatings for not working. The sadder part of this is that many sweatshop workers only work for the money they are given, which can be very little.

						<h3>The positives of keeping Sweatshops</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>- Sweatshops, besides their working conditions, can be seen as beneficial to a family or community. Sweatshop workers are paid around $50 per month which is seen as terrible pay in western eyes, however we need to remember that one kilogram of rice can cost between $0.25 and $0.48 (wholesale.)  </li>
							<li>- If sweatshops were to close, many people would go into much more dangerous working environments, such as subsistence farming, a type of farming that is not economically viable, can cause environmental damage and can even cause death. </li>
							<li>- Sweatshops also reduce poverty as they give people the jobs that pay more than their other, previously mentioned, more dangerous jobs. </li>
							<li>- Sweatshops can also empower women as they delay marriage and pregnancy and increase school enrollment. </li>
							<li>- Sweatshops are also seen as good from a western standpoint too, since the sweatshops supply westerners with cheap clothing that can be used for people in need. </li>
						</ul>

						<h3>The Negatives of keeping Sweatshops</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>- Sweatshops do, however, suffer from grueling workdays and still little pay, even though the prices of food and other products are different. </li>
							<li>- Sweatshops can also be bad for the environment as they can lead to nearby water sources, which could be used for drinking, being polluted with dyes and sorts. </li>
							<li>- Sweatshops also have appalling and often dangerous working conditions that children from as young as six years old have to work in. </li>
							<li> -Sweatshops Destroy the childhood of children too, which could lead to further problems for that child in the future. </li>
							<li> -Sweatshops often have unfair wages between men and women too, which shows how they treat their workers unfairly and act corrupt. </li>
						</ul>
